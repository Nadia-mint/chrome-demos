demos
=====

Just some html+JS demos to be accessed publicly. Forto access, the easiest way is to prepend `https://rawgit.com/` (or `htmlpreview.github.io`) :

[https://rawgit.com/Miguelao/demos/master/gum_multi.html]
(https://rawgit.com/Miguelao/demos/master/gum_multi.html)

(Or
[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Miguelao/demos/blob/master/mediarecorder.html]
(https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Miguelao/demos/blob/master/mediarecorder.html)
)

- [Simplest camera capture and display]([https://rawgit.com/Miguelao/demos/master/gum_simple.html])
- [MediaRecorder demo](https://rawgit.com/Miguelao/demos/master/mediarecorder.html)
- [Capture from a <video> tag]([https://rawgit.com/Miguelao/demos/master/videoelementcapture.html])

- [Single camera multiple resolutions](https://goo.gl/razUHd)
- [Simultanenous opening of all available cameras](https://goo.gl/yIa75b)

I got some typical ones shortened as goo.gl permalinks, but is best not to rely on them.
